I'm Dr James Broderick, an Irish-American researcher currently based in Seoul, South Korea. My main research interests are Extended/Mixed Reality, Human-Computer Interaction, Digital Twin, and Spatial Audio. Outside of research and work I love music, games, anime, and generally nerdy stuff. I have a post dedicated to my old radio show that can be found [here][fractal]. The main purpose of this website is to keep track of my projects, provide some information on myself, and practice some new skills.

If you want to know more about my work and background, you can read more [here][about] or check my [resume][resume]. I love having the opportunity to chat with and meet new people, so be sure to reach out on my socials if you have something you want to discuss!
