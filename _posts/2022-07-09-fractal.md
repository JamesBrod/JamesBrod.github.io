Fractal on FlirtFM was [FlirtFM's][flirt] first asian music radio show, and quite likely the first asian music radio show in Ireland! Created in 2015, I joined as a full-time host in 2016, eventually becoming the solo full-time host until May of 2022. Our aim was to provide a place for people to hear news about anime, gaming, asian music, and local nerdy activities, all while showcasing new music from across Asia. 

While we may be finished now, you can check out our older shows at our [Mixcloud][fractal], or for more recent episodes and other great shows you can check the [FlirtFM archive][archive].

You should also check out [Intuigthe][intuighe], our sister show fully in Irish! Intuigthe was started by the former hosts of Fractal and is still an ongoing show. You can check out old and new episodes from them [here][intuigmix].
