**Forward Into Dark Noir ~ Black Raven** was a a game created as part of the Galway Games Jam, a collaboration between [TerraCorrupt][terra] and myself. The concept was to make a bullet-hell or danmaku style game similar to the Touhou series of games. While we didn't win, we were very proud of what we got working with about 10 hours of work total, including time spent attempting to get multiplayer working, which unfortunately was made more difficult due to venue internet firewalls. You can find the GitHub for the game [here][git].

I provided the majority of the coding for the game, most of which is straightforward Unity coding, with some simple mathmatical calculations to create bullet patterns. Terra created the wonderful music for the game, which was also heavily inspired by the music from the Touhou games.
